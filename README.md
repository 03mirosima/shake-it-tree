# About This Project

Shaking a Tree with React!

You can see a live version of this repo <a href="https://03mirosima.github.io/shake-it-tree/" target="_blank">here</a>

There is a tree with big, juicy and red apples on it. We want to collect those apples but we can't reach them. Because the tree is very high. We have to shake the tree to drop apples. After that, we can put the apples to our apple basket.
